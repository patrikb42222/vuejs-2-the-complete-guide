National Organization is located on

tables outside the hall I would also

like to note that national mental

illness Awareness Week starts on October

declared by Congress in 1990 and so we

usually try to have a program every year

at this time to really highlight that

mental illness Awareness Week it gives

me great pleasure to introduce dr.

Amador for many in this audience he

really needs no introduction dr. Amador

is a teacher lecturer and author basic

Columbia University and the creator of

the lis program and without further ado

please help me welcome dr. Amador

Larry and thanks to Nami Cambridge for

bringing us all together tonight I'm

going to talk about something that is

very important to me from a professional

perspective I'll tell you a little bit

about my professional background so you

have some sense of how I come to you

tonight the body of experiences but also

it's very personal I had a brother with

schizophrenia who really is the one who

gave me the title for this talk and for

the book by the same name I'm not sick

I don't need help how many of you in the

audience have heard someone that you

love or someone that you're caring for

is a health care professional say I'm

not sick I don't need help look around

everybody and keep your hand up this

saves me showing you a lot of research

slides good for those watching this at

home every hand went up I don't think

any hand didn't go up this is a very

very common problem I will talk about

how how common it is in just a moment

but just briefly a little bit about

about myself I started out working as a

nurse's aide back in 1982 and I was

working in an inpatient psychiatric ward

an emergency room later with the Tucson

Police Department doing crisis work and

one thing that I saw over and over again

is that we would work really really hard

to help people with schizophrenia

bipolar disorder schizotypal

of course psychotic illnesses that

affect really well over four million

Americans if you combined them all we'd

help them get well we'd help them to

stop hearing voices perhaps if they were

suffering from grandiose or paranoid

delusions to stop responding to or even

believing those delusions through

medication through support through

psychoeducation all sorts of services we

discharge them from from the hospital

sometimes meeting them in a crisis

situation on the street bringing them to

an emergency room getting them into the

hospital getting them from our

perspective well and what do you think

would happen

they'd come back back then in the early

80s we used to call you miss eclis used

to call patients like that frequent

flyers today people refer to them I'm

sorry back then we call them revolving

door patients today the the euphemism is

frequent fliers none of them really

capture the tragedy of repeated relapse

when someone relapses it there's some

evidence that it may in fact be toxic to

the to the brain that's not conclusive

but certainly there's no question that

it it's it's disruptive to the

individual to the family to the person's

attempts at recovery recovering a life

with relationships with work whether

it's paid work or volunteer work or

returning to school so I come I come to

this problem really from a very personal

and professional perspective I want to

start with the personal perspective and

I'm going to talk to you about leaf it's

a program that really grew out of my

relationship with my brother Henry poor

insight affects relationships whether

you're a healthcare provider or a family

member it affects your relationship so I

want to talk about my relationship with

my brother before I do so I have a sense

of who's in the room how many are family

members of somebody with one of these

illnesses okay most hands going up how

many are health care providers I'm

seeing about a third of the room also

healthcare providers any consumers in

the room anyone ever been treated for

mental illness I have good so not good

sorry but good that you got help and I'm

glad I got help I saw about forty five

hands go up any law enforcement in the

room I saw at least one police officer

trying to sneak beverage in where are

you raise your hand Dave that's not

I do I hope she comes back in she was

going to bring coffee in but somebody

busted her hi am I asking about law

enforcement because our law enforcement

community often times have become the

first responders the people who are

filling the gaps in our health care

system so this is a great group we're

the stakeholders were these so-called

patients were the family members who are

trying to help our loved ones with the

health care providers and we even have

law enforcement here there's others as

well but those are the main stakeholders

let me talk about my brother and me

about our relationship and how this

problem of poor insight and how I

handled it affected our relationship

this is a picture of Henry and and me

when we immigrated to Cincinnati Ohio

from Cuba after the Revolution our

father had been killed in in the Cuban

Revolution that's a long story and we

don't have time for it here but Henry

being 8 years older than me was much

more than a brother he was in many

respects like an older sorry like a

father a father figure he taught me how

to ride a bicycle how to throw a

baseball he taught me the value of

insight and self-confidence he was a

very self-confident popular talented

young man throughout his life really up

until the onset of his illness who was

very well liked had girlfriends had jobs

went to university but was always really

humble and was one of those people who

always when he had problems with other

people would ask himself what did I do

you know he really was a self-reflective

insightful person and I'd like to think

I picked up on some of that although

some people would say I didn't I'm some

of those qualities of self-reflection

that's Henry looking in the window if

you haven't figured it out and me

driving our first car as 64 comment I

think it was pretending to drive it we

were very very close he would tell you

if you were alive today and I

I'll touch briefly on on his death it's

not really relevant to the talk but it

is in a way relevant to this whole

notion of how lack of insight affects

relationships he lost my train of

thought there whenever I talk about is

that that makes me pause for a moment he

didn't die from his illness just so you

know it was from an accident but it was

a very telling event the way in which he

died it said a lot about his character

we were very oh what I was going to say

is if he were alive today he would tell

you javi is my hobby my little brother

he call me javi for Xavier yeah he's my

best friend and Henry was my best friend

when he became ill in 1981 I was a

senior in college and Henry was 29 he'd

actually been ill for about five years

we just didn't know it he'd withdrawn a

lot of negative symptoms negative

symptoms for those of you who don't know

are things like an inability to express

emotion a very kind of flat effect not

using gestures the person seems to just

not care about much anhedonia a loss of

interest in things loss of motivation

these are some of the negative symptoms

we saw on my brother and we

misinterpreted as being lazy not trying

and it created tension in our family

with my parents my stepfather my mother

and and Henry and me and others first

psychotic episode 1981 hearing voices

delusional believed our mother was the

devil her eyes were laser beams he would

show me the lacerations on his arms

there were no lacerations but he would

show me what he saw which were actual

you know cuts in his arm from my

mother's laser beams and he got

hospitalized I was elected to be the

family member to deal with Henry because

I was the quote psychologist in the

family for those of you who remember if

you went to college your senior year in

college just because I was studying

psychology I didn't know

I was doing I certainly wasn't wasn't a

psychologist but Henry and I were very

close which is probably probably the

other reason I was elected to to try and

engage him I begged him to go to the

hospital I tried to describe his

symptoms we were all seeing he was

disheveled he didn't smell good he was

talking out loud to his voices he had

these delusions he said no there's

nothing wrong with me you're the crazy

one not me leave me alone how do you

think I got him to the hospital anyone

hmm

police now how did you guess that if ESP

experienced I asked the same question in

the Netherlands a couple of months ago I

asked the same question in Turkey eight

months ago I asked the same question in

Taiwan about nine months ago and in San

Diego just a couple of months ago and

always I get the same answer I had to

call the police to get my loved one to

the hospital so poor insight recession

affects relationships he would not go he

could not go is really how I think about

it today and I could not turn the other

way he was getting sicker and sicker and

more and more a danger to himself I

won't go into all the details so he goes

to the hospital he gets well he gets

treatment gets well from our perspective

he's not talking to his voices he's not

delusional he's not paranoid he promises

to go to the outpatient partial

hospitalization program but it was

called back then take his medicine

except a psychiatrist a social worker

and we came home after our family

meeting he had been in the hospital for

weeks

Anki imagine a four week hospitalization

nowadays or lucky if we could for days

but for weeks he was there he came home

where do you think I found his bottle of

anti-psychotic medication

you all read my mind this is a really

phenomenal again all over the world over

this country I asked the question I get

the same answer we have a common

experience here in this room and anyone

who has a loved one or a patient or a

client with these illnesses that doesn't

understand they're ill these are the

behaviors we see my reaction to it makes

a big difference my reaction to do to it

was to confront the denial I thought it

was denial so I fished his bottle of I

think it's a generic drug now

haloperidol it's the first

anti-psychotic after Thorazine and I

picked it out and I said you know why

aren't you taking this and he said I'm

not sick I don't need it

so what you promise you take it he said

well I I needed it then but I don't need

it now and that started seven years of

arguing you know that you're sick in him

saying no you're the crazy one that's

like I used to say the psychiatrist had

brainwashed me and there's always an

element of truth to any delusion but not

that I was brainwashed but I certainly

had really been trained to think of

approaching him in a certain way which

was with the medical approach which is

you have a diagnosis here's the

prognosis here's the treatment take your

medicine and this next picture which is

the cover of the book I was talking

about best describes our relationship

it's not much of a relationship is it

during the first seven years of his

illness when we had no relationship he

or it was an adversarial relationship a

lot of fighting he was homeless for a

while he left the house in anger he was

hospitalized about four times a year

okay almost 30 times perhaps more than

30 times I lost count

so hospitalized a lot most of the time

I'd say about a third of the time

actually involuntarily and the majority

of the time voluntarily I put that in

quotes

I say voluntarily because I would or the

police officer by my side would say to

him you can sign or the psychiatrist in

the emergency room you can sign yourself

in or we're going to admit you in

volunteer

early so you practice common sense and

he signed himself in but he wasn't a

voluntary patient he never understood

that he had a mental illness during this

time I was training to become a

psychologist I started picking up some

skills which I'm going to give you more

than an introduction I'm hoping we'll

have some time to practice some of those

skills that that became the leap program

and the first thing I learned was to

shut up stop telling my brother he was

sick to shut up and start listening

pardon the harshness but I I needed to

hear it

said to me that way I was talking to his

supervisor about a patient and I said

hey can I talk to you about my brother

and I'll never forget this and he said

once you just shut up about this seven

years you've been telling it me sick is

it has it made a difference no what's

the result he hates me

I mean we went from that relationship to

no relationship so I not only stopped

telling if he was mentally ill I

promised him I would never again tell

him he was mentally ill so now what is

where does that leave me

right well we're going to come back

we're going to come to that we're going

to take a little detour in a moment

before we get to what do you do if

you're not going to be arguing with the

person and by the way that one of the

definitions of insanity is you keep

doing the same thing over and over and

over again expecting a different result

I was insane for those seven years right

keep that in mind as I try to teach you

some different ways of approaching

people whatever relationship look like

the last 18 years of his life well in

the last 18 years of his life I stopped

telling him he was mentally ill I

started listening to his goals his

desires I engaged with him with a really

different way of communicating let him

take the lead I convinced them to take a

long acting therapy a long-acting

injectable treatment so when he missed

an appointment I knew it and I could

talk to him and he was hospitalized one

time in 18 years voluntarily and this is

what our relationship looked like

you know the love that we have always

had was always there but it was buried

beneath years of arguing over whether he

was mentally ill or not so if you leave

here tonight with nothing but that

please consider if you've been trying

for three six nine months three six ten

years to convince a loved one or a

client or a patient they're mentally ill

and they either overtly say you know

you're wrong or they become very docile

and submissive and you keep thinking I

don't think they're being honest with me

about taking the medicine in other words

they've gained common sense I'm not

going to tell my doctor what I really

think because if I tell her or him what

I really think I'm going to get another

lecture about being mentally ill if

you're seeing that you might want to

consider doing things differently it

took me a long time to get there the

911s is in the news all the time poor

insight in schizophrenia and bipolar

disorder is very very common I'm using

the term denial in quotes for a reason

I'll get to it in just a moment this is

a picture of Margaret Mary Rae does

anybody remember who Margaret Mary Rae

was Margaret Mary Rae many of you know

as David Letterman's stalker this is

many years ago now but we still remember

her and it's really sad that her legacy

is that she's remembered really because

of a symptom of her mental illness she

had the delusion that she was married to

the late night television host David

Letterman she would be in his in his

Greenwich Connecticut mansion when he

came home she took his car once she got

lots of jail time never got treatment

never got consistent treatment she died

like many many people with these

illnesses died she died from suicide now

I don't say people commit suicide in the

context of serious mental illness I

think the research shows that my

experience has convinced me that suicide

is a consequence of the brain disorder

not a knowing and voluntary decision

and one's life so I don't like to use

the phrase you know Margaret Mary

committed suicide rather she died from

suicide never understanding never

believing she was mentally ill ended up

in our criminal justice system like so

many people now we don't know the

details but I must have had 20 interview

requests after the shooting in Colorado

and then what do we learn this is

somebody who was in treatment for

schizophrenia we don't know the details

yet so I'm not going to infer anything

more than that but these are so common

these stories the first case I ever

worked on was that of Ted Kaczynski this

is Ted graduate graduating from high

school on the left on the right is when

he was arrested I never forget seeing

that picture of his arrest and thinking

this kind of looks like he probably is

mentally ill I was one of six experts

that diagnosed him with paranoid

schizophrenia the judges own expert

agreed with all of us Ted wanted to fire

his attorneys because he said I'm not

sick and I am NOT going to let you

present evidence of a mental illness

that I don't have even though he

understood that that was probably the

only evidence that would have saved his

life because he had a journal where he

described the bombings for those of you

who don't remember the Unabomber who has

a name Ted we don't remember Ted's story

Ted was turned in by his brother David

once David recognized the manifesto that

that Ted got published after one of his

terrorism threats long before 9/11

tecna's insky had shut down our airline

system for a day and if you remember

that because he threatened to bomb the

airlines again 25 years the FBI couldn't

find them it took his brother took a

family member to to really stop the

tragedies that his mental illness was

causing not only murder but maiming

people and terrifying people but it was

mental illness it is mental illness the

judges own expert agreed with us this is

not one of those battle of the experts

stories and the government once the

judges expert agreed made a deal and

said you know rather than seeking the

death penalty which is what they were

doing to settle the case because they

probably would have had a harder time

getting the death penalty so you know we

look at the headlines and unfortunately

that story gets out a lot more than all

the other wonderful stories about my

brother's 18 years of recovery when he

died he had a girlfriend he had

part-time volunteer work he had an

amazing routine that included going to a

clubhouse and spending time with people

with serious mental illness even though

from Henry's perspective he didn't have

a serious mental illness but they were

his friends you know all those stories

of engaging people in treatment who

understand their ill and those who don't

understand their ill don't usually make

it to the headlines but those are just

some illustrations and everywhere I go

I'll often pull stories from the local

press because this is this is everywhere

it is not unique to Cambridge to

Massachusetts or the United States so I

have a question for you for you all

about denial of illness would you agree

with me that denial impairs common sense

judgment about the need for treatment if

you agree with me if the answer is yes

raise your hand or say yes say yeah yeah

okay I completely disagree if I come

over here and take the perspective of

Ted Kaczynski Margaret Mary ray Henry

Amador my brother and the countless

patients that I've treated over the

years who don't understand they're ill

it's common sense to refuse treatment

then put it to you a different way if

you do not have diabetes you're certain

you don't have diabetes let's forget

about how you got to that certainty that

you are certain you don't have it would

you inject yourself with insulin raise

your hand anyone and not one hand is

going up why not you don't need it it

could hurt you couldn't it what else so

in your mind you're certain that you

don't have it but why else wouldn't you

inject yourself with insulin one more

what I haven't heard that one before

okay I'll ah I hope so

what else it hurts what else hmm fear

fear of what what would happen if you

injected yourself with insulin anyone

here medically minded you worry about

contaminated needles but what else you

could die thank you that's the answer I

was looking for I'm sorry you could get

hurt insulin shock you'd go into insulin

shock the reason I wanted to elicit that

particular answer along with you don't

need the insulin it could hurt you it

could actually kill you is because

that's what I've heard from my patients

over the years about antipsychotic

medications they hurt me I don't need

them they cause the symptoms anyone hear

these kinds of reasons for not taking

medicine it could kill me they're

addictive is another thing we hear so if

you don't understand you're ill if you

don't believe you're ill it is actually

common sense to refuse treatment right

so you have to find another reason to

accept treatment not it's not because

you understand you're ill I've been

using the word denial are we dealing

with denial we're not in most instances

we're dealing with another symptom of

these brain disorders right the brain is

used for many things perceiving thinking

making judgments also assessing our own

state of well-being and in fact what

we're probably dealing with is a

syndrome symptom rather called Annis

Ignacio

this is a very hard word to say I didn't

coin the term this was coined by a

Hungarian psychiatrist in 1919 working

with Charcot in France

Charcot who had trained Freud his name

the sect this neurologist rather was

Babinski you may have heard of the

Babinski reflex he scraped the bottom of

the foot and the toes curl up same same

neurologist and he described patients

for example who were paralyzed in one

side of their body and they didn't know

it now I did a one-year neurology

rotation at Beth Israel Hospital in New

York City and I saw this I saw much more

than this I saw a woman who was blind

due to cortical damage to her occipital

lobes and she didn't know she was blind

unbelievable conversations I tried to

show her that she was blind and she

would accuse me of turning the lights

off in her room when she would bump into

things it's a very very severe

unawareness we're going to come back to

this how many of you have heard this

term before raise your hand wonderful

more than half so things are getting

better there's a big gap between science

and knowledge public knowledge and

professional knowledge when I started my

research career in 1989 actually was in

85 but as an independent researcher I

was involved in the revision of the DSM

so this is I can't do math 1989 is how

many years ago

14:00 I wish I think it's why Matt I

think it's 20 23 years ago or something

yeah and we developed a scale my

colleagues and I just to measure insight

back then I just want to give you some

perspective very quickly back then when

I was interested in this in this subject

because it might experience with my

brother and with so many patients I was

trying to help who kept coming back to

kept throwing away their medication who

kept fighting with their family members

I looked at the research and I found

almost nothing there were about 10

studies only 10 studies looking at this

big problem and and they suggested that

a majority of people had problems with

insight so we started doing research we

also published guidelines for doing

research today there were close to 300

studies so during the course of my

career we've gone from 10 studies to

close to 300 and I want to tell you

about one of the earlier studies the

first one that that we did just looking

at how common the problem is because

it's been replicated over and over again

just as an illustration

this was the dsm-4 field trial study we

looked at people who were in their first

episode people who were sick for 10

years 20 years 30 years all over the

country into international sites what we

found was that basically nearly 60

percent were moderately to severely

unaware these first two on the left

slices of the pie right 32 percent were

unaware and 25 percent were moderately

aware only 40 percent were aware they

had any kind of problem a nervous

condition schizophrenia we gave them

credit for awareness if they said things

like I've had a nervous breakdown we

also saw that there was a lot of

unawareness of signs and symptoms of the

illness those findings have been

replicated over and over and over again

in there's 300 studies roughly 300

studies in the last 23 years turns out

is an interesting bit of research I just

share with you there's other problems

with insight or awareness turns out that

if you look at people with schizophrenia

who have tardive dyskinesia that

movement disorder that the older

medications in particular can cause they

don't know it so they don't see that

their arms are doing this or that they

have perioral grimacing they can look in

a mirror you can do a rating scale and

that's what these investigators did why

would half of all patients with

schizophrenia not see a movement

disorder it's not starting to sound like

denial when I first read this research

starting to sound like something very

different but again here's the headline

this is a very well replicated finding

in the scientific literature now for the

last 20 plus years that approximately

half - more than half of our patients

with schizophrenia we find this also in

bipolar disorder don't believe they're

ill and the unawareness goes on for the

lifetime of the illness

some people do develop true insight it's

very rare or true awareness I'm going to

start using the terms awareness and

unawareness now right because denial

suggests that you actually know

something that you're just suppressing

the knowledge when you're unaware you're

really just unaware okay what's the

problem with antipsychotic medications

what do you think I'm going to say about

that side-effects well you can change

the dose or switch medications and

usually resolve that problem what would

you say is the biggest problem yes

patients take them every day in somebody

else okay yes

they don't work well enough for some

people the response rate hovers around

70% for four pretty good symptom

management and about forty to fifty

percent with a very good response so I

might disagree that they don't work very

well for a minority but they work fairly

well for symptoms right they're not

they're not the Silver Bullet but

they're an important part of the

treatment right yes

so the problem is I'm going to

paraphrase and tell me if I'm right

basically that that there's a lot of

variability that people respond to the

medication is differently depending on

how they metabolize this is such a big

problem it's so right in front of you

that no one's said it yes thank you

they don't take them

they people with schizophrenia

schizoaffective bipolar and related

disorders do not take the medication so

we can do all the efficacy studies in

the world the FDA can approve these

medications for these conditions but if

no one's taking the medications they're

useless right how bad is the problem

this study finds that between 50 and 75

percent of people with schizophrenia

exhibit complete or partial non

adherence in any given time just look

cross-sectionally at the population or

big samples of people on these drugs

think about that number 50 to 75 percent

if you're only taking some of the

medication what happens when you only

take some of your antibiotics you don't

get well which is what people do poor

adherence is a problem across a range of

medical disorders but in fact

comparative studies find that it's far

worse actually in people with

schizophrenia and bipolar disorder than

it is in other medical conditions I hear

this all the time well you know poor

adherence or quote compliance is a

problem with all sorts of prop issues

and medical conditions like hypertension

yes people forget to take their pills

but nowhere near as much as this nowhere

near as high and the consequences aren't

the same when somebody with hypertension

or heart disease forgets to take their

medication they don't end up in jails

and prisons or dying from suicide or

homeless consequences are very different

so this is a big public health problem

in a very tragic problem in my view for

those of you in the room for our

prescribers prescribed medication if

your patients are like most people with

schizophrenia I'm just going to talk

about schizophrenia now within seven to

ten days of writing your prescription

only one out of four will be taking the

medication within a year half of the

people you've written that prescription

for will likely be off the medication

within two years three out of four

so we have really a major problem here

in medications indicated if medication

is helpful most people with these

illnesses like my brother don't take

them for good reason if you take their

perspective they're certain they're not

ill so why should they take them so what

do we do

it could be that they're feeling better

that's not what's predicting these

numbers I'm going to come to that in

just a moment that is certainly one

thing that does happen people feel

better and they say okay I don't want to

take the medication anymore but let's

talk about what predicts good adherence

okay the biggest predictor if you look

at all the research on this of who will

take medication and take it reliably is

guess what awareness of being ill most

of the studies still use the word

insight I don't like insight because it

makes it sound like we're studying

denial or not it's the absence of a

symptom the absence of Annis Ignacio

could you try repeating it after me once

one more time I know sick nausea very

good reason I'm doing that is that

people will tell me I was talking to

colleagues about that symptom but I can

never say the word it's really enough I

wish I could give it a new name if you

have trouble pronouncing anise Ignasi I

just say unawareness the unawareness

symptom and if you don't believe it's a

symptom yet I'm going to provide you

with some more information and you can

decide for yourself so if you know

you're ill one of the best top two

predictors if you look at all the

research all the reviews of studies meta

analyses for those of you who know about

research and meta-analysis is actually

taking 50 60 even more studies and re

analyzing all the data and pulling it

together and they find if you know

you're ill and you have schizophrenia

you're likely to take your medication

reliably you're in that mine or minority

that 25% that takes the medication

reliably but we have a problem

because we know that half of our are

people with schizophrenia don't take

don't believe they're ill and bipolar

disorder so what's the other predictor

do you think of who takes medication

reliably

so if they have a relationship with

somebody who they care about my brother

Henry had a relationship with me and he

loved me very much and he cared about me

and we had seven years of fighting and

anger and a paranoia on both our parts I

wrote a column for schizophrenia

magazine where I talked about violence

and how I used to lock the door at night

when he was psychotic and how I how

ashamed I felt locking the door against

my own brother who had raised me but

protected me so that it doesn't fit with

my experience and certainly not what the

research shows you're on the right track

though yes good communication with

someone you love okay I like that I

think you're heading closer to my next

bullet point whether it's right or wrong

you'll decide anyone else before I go

there here okay being listened to you've

read my book right yeah okay not anyone

who's read the book communication and

Trust with the provider you actually hit

upon it most of the research show has

been done with therapists caseworkers

and prescribing psychiatrist nurse

practitioners so most of the research is

in that area so that's what we can talk

about but I can tell you that there's

additional research not as much it can

be a family member it can be a police

officer of a wonderful story if we have

time of a police officer in in Dobbs

Ferry who got somebody into treatment

whose family convinced this police

officer to do conference calls with me

to learn how to use some of the leap

communication tools to convince this

young man to get into treatment because

this young man trusted this this officer

it can be anyone and what's the nature

of the relationship it's it's a

relationship with somebody who listens

to you without judgment well that sounds

easy

dad I'm not mentally ill you and Mom are

the crazy ones the problem is that

you're trying to poison me and kill me

how do you listen to that and not react

and not judge it how do you respect that

person's point of view sounds crazy

right you can do it I'm going to teach

you I'm going to show you a few few

techniques a few tools but it's vitally

important if someone really feels are

being poisoned by their parents if

somebody really feels really believes

they don't feel they are certain but the

CIA is watching them and so they want to

put paint all the windows in the house

black I'm working with a family where

the mother has barricaded all the doors

creating a really dangerous situation

with furniture because of the people who

are against the family and trying to

steal their valuables there's so many

stories in this room right how do you

respect that person's point of view

without agreeing with it without making

it worse right we're going to talk about

that I'm going to show you some some

some some tools and that relationship is

with someone who not only listens to you

without judgment not only respects your

point of view but you know that that

person thinks you'd benefit from

treatment how do you get there this is

by the way the most important point this

is what leap is aiming to do it's to

build a trusting respectful relationship

where my opinion that the person ought

to consider my recommendations starts to

matter because I have first listened to

their reality their convictions and I

haven't dismissed them I haven't told

them they're crazy I haven't told them

they're wrong I used to tell my brother

when all he said he said all I need is a

girlfriend a job and go back to school

why isn't that crazy I want those things

I thought it was I thought it was a part

of the term but you know I

was young and didn't understand stigma

very well and I used to say to and

that's crazy Henry you're putting the

cart before the horse you got to get

well before you going to get any of

those things I changed my tact and it

changed our relationship and it changed

his ability to accept treatment and and

it wasn't just me it was also his

treatment team so what causes poor

insight my training was psychoanalytic

originally in the 80s and we heard and

read lengthy case descriptions of how

this is psychotic denial as

defensiveness this person really knows

deep down inside he just won't what

admit it so almost like it's almost like

interrogating a prisoner isn't it just

admit it you know you're mentally ill

that's how it feels when I've talked to

people who have been on the other side

of this and they say I feel like I'm

being interrogated by my doctor by my

caseworker by my family members did you

take your medicine

etc we've done studies other people have

done studies we can measure how

defensive somebody is believe it or not

there are some pretty good measurements

of how defensive somebody's personality

is and when you look at those measures

and correlate it to the measures of

illness awareness does the person

understand they're ill they don't

correlate very well so that's not proof

but it certainly suggests that that's

not what's predicting unawareness it's

not defensive miss people with or

without mental illness get defensive

everybody does so we'll deal with

defensive miss but that's it you gotta

understand the root of the problem

because if it's defensive 'no sand

denial you'll do what i did for seven

years with my brother henry and keep

doing it you try to break through the

denial and break through that barrier of

denial so that he gets to the knowledge

that he has deep down inside well guess

what it's not there

not if it's antacid nausea and not if

it's unawareness there is no knowledge

of being L as implausible as that sounds

so we've looked at other things I'm

going to jump over this and and get

right to neuropsychological deficits in

in 1991

my colleagues and I at Columbia

University working in the skits

research unit wrote a paper at where we

reviewed the literature and there was

only about a dozen studies back in 91

and we said look this is a big problem a

little bit of research out there shows

this is a huge problem it impacts course

of illness hospitalization risk of

suicide inability to accept treatment

right why aren't we studying this and

then we set out guidelines for

measurements and and then people started

doing research and one of the first

studies and we also proposed the idea

that maybe this is a symptom of the

brain disorder like what one more I

didn't hear you

very good and no sig no SIA and the

field jumped on this we've about fifty

studies now showing links to neuro

psychological dysfunction brain imaging

showing a reduced white matter in the in

the frontal cortex all sorts of findings

that point to among other things

primarily executive dysfunction I'm not

going to review those slides because I

want to get to practical communication

tools and listen if if this feels in any

way offensive like I'm saying that

someone's belief they're not ill is just

a symptom I hope you'll give me the

benefit of the doubt my goal here is not

to diagnose anybody from the stage I

can't do that and and opinions do matter

and if anything that's what the whole

focus of leap is whether it's a symptom

the truth or something in between

understanding and respecting somebody's

opinion about their life and themselves

is the first step to a relationship and

without a relationship there is no

treatment there is no recovery in 1999

Michael Flom of University of Iowa and I

were asked by the American Psychiatric

Association to chair the revision of the

text in the DSM is anybody not know what

the DSM is okay the DSM is the

Diagnostic Manual that that every mental

health professional uses in this country

and and in many countries worldwide so

it's it's our diagnostic Bible if you

will and dr. flomm and I were asked to

make the text reflect science not

opinion right this is not the diagnostic

criteria this is everything around it

the book is this big there's a lot of

Education in the book like how common is

is the disorder what are the Associated

features that you'll see so this is a

of putting together a team of experts

from around the world around this

country and sending them at that time I

think it was about 60 articles on lack

of awareness and asking them to put

together a proposal what should we say

in the DSM about poor insight right at

that time we were still using the term

and here's what they came up with the

majority of individuals with

schizophrenia have poor insight

regarding the fact that they have a

psychotic illness evidence meaning

research evidence suggests that poor

insight is a manifestation of the

illness itself it's a little wordy right

but it's a symptom of the illness or a

sign of the illness rather than a coping

strategy like denial it may be

comparable to the lack of awareness of

neurological deficits seen in stroke

termed anise Ignacio thank you this is

an important symptom this is what this

peer review process concluded this

symptom they're calling it a symptom for

14 years 13 years now this has been

recognized as a symptom and you'll still

talk to experts even experts at the

American Psychiatric Association who are

talking about denial even though in

their book I'm not a member of the APA

cuz I'm a psychologist even though in

you know I'm saying it's their book the

peer review process indicates that this

is a symptom I'll come back to this in a

minute but let's just read what what the

consensus was this symptom predisposes

the individual to the very first thing

that this group found was non-compliance

with treatment and we've known that for

25 years 30 years and it's also been

found to be predictive of higher relapse

rates increased number of involuntary

hospital admissions a poor course of

illness and among the thing is measured

here under poor course of illness

quality of relationships with loved ones

are poor inability to work return

school poor functioning and a poor

course of illness so this is a very

important symptom just unawareness of

illness and in the dsm-5 there will be I

believe more language about this and

that's even stronger but we'll see what

the process ends up with because there's

a lot of controversy with the dsm-5 so

let's talk about anis Ignacio real real

quick because we're really close to

talking about using some communication

tools to engage people in treatment who

don't understand they're ill or even

people who do understand they're ill how

can we communicate with them more

respectfully and not judge judging them

and give our opinions in a way that's

respectful but first let's talk about

anis Ignasi the first patient that I

evaluated I'll never forget this is a

man who had suffered a stroke about five

days before I saw him he was awake he

was alert when I interviewed him I knew

he was paralyzed on the left side of his

body yet hemiparesis and the stroke

affected also the frontal lobes of his

brain not just the motor area for those

of you who know about strokes so it also

affected executive dis functioning I

asked him can you move your arm he said

sure no problem okay he did move his arm

I asked him what happened and he said

and I just didn't feel like it and it's

interesting at that moment I had my

first connection to my brother I

remember sitting at the edge of his bed

for hours a few years into his illness

trying to show him his symptoms of

illness not unlike this neurological

patient I was trying to show this man

that he was paralyzed I asked him to

move his arm he couldn't move it and

what does he say I just don't feel like

it I was trying to show my brother his

impairment I said Henery he used to work

he used to have friends used to have

girlfriends in the last three years you

haven't you haven't done any of those

things don't you think something's wrong

right I'm trying to show him teach him

he has impairments

deficits and do you know what he said to

me I just don't feel like it

same exact thing and the worst part for

our relationship as I believed him

I remember feeling angry and like he

wasn't motivated and I had a deal with

my mother crying and complaining about

Henry that he's not trying and it was a

really vicious cycle because I didn't

understand but let's go back to this

neurological patient so I asked him

actually did this three times but I'm

just going to tell you the last two

times so I asked him to move his arm he

said he didn't feel like it I asked him

could you try one more time please

I was in training and I said my grade

depended on it I'm sorry healing to him

as a young trainee because he didn't

want to do it he did not want to do it

he was getting really kind of frightened

looking so he agrees he can't move his

arm I asked him what happened and he

didn't want to tell me so I had to keep

reassuring him you know it's okay you

know whatever the reason is you couldn't

move your arm you know I'm not going to

judge you

I forget what I said so many years ago

like 1987 I think 88 and he finally said

you've done something to my arm when I

asked him what he thought I did he said

either we we had put something in the IV

that paralyzed the arm which actually

would be impossible because it's an IV

so go all over his body would paralyzed

everything or that I had somehow

restrained it with with straps right so

this is a very very severe lack of

awareness of in his case neurological

deficits paralysis the belief that he

can move his arm that he's not ill that

he doesn't have these deficits persisted

despite the evidence didn't I show him

evidence and he explained away the

evidence with confabulations that's a

technical term and when my brother said

to me I don't feel like getting a job or

having friends or a girl or a girlfriend

it not only contradicted things he said

at other times but I really think it was

a confabulation that as I tried to point

out the ways in which he

was wrong and I was right that he was

sick

what it triggers is him trying to find

some explanation well it must be that I

just don't feel like it not a conscious

process it's a brain reflex right give a

tell a story and say oh wait wait wait

it didn't happen that way

you ever do that that's a confabulation

it's a memory gap and you and as you're

telling the story you fill the memory in

with with the confabulation that's an

everyday confabulation I've had the the

privilege and and and the luxury because

it gives me an understanding I wouldn't

have had otherwise

of interviewing probably oh well over a

thousand people with unawareness of

illness so I have a really good sense

and working in clinical practice with

people that's who get referred to me who

don't understand they're ill for four

decades I want to give you a little feel

for what it's like to have this first

question is anyone in the room currently

married okay

I need a volunteer you don't have to be

happily married just married can I pick

on you yeah would you mind walking to

this microphone over here for a second

and tell everybody your first name only

pleased Cecile Cecile and Cecile how

long is it that you've been married

third evil 30 years 30 years I'm going

to ask people not to laugh please and

I'm going to ask for your patience

because I was going to pick Cecile even

if she didn't volunteer actually I did

please don't laugh actually I did pick

you didn't I yes ha what's the name of

the man that you believe you're married

to Jack Jack if you have children

together yes that's what I understand

how many five five children and I put

again ask everyone's patience we'll try

to do this very quickly are you here

with anybody

Cecile yes who you here with my sister

and your sister raise her hand um I

think she had to leave because she was

getting dry eyes that's interesting yeah

so she's not here no I think she may

have gotten cold feet cuz your sister

and I spoke before this um when she

heard that Nami was sponsoring this top

she wanted you to come did you want to

come to this yeah bring her - she bring

you

we agreed to come together right and she

contacted me because it turns out that

you're not in fact married - his name is

Jack right in fact I have right here in

front of me something like seven

restraining orders filed against you to

stay away from Jack and his kids

how many kids is it that you believe you

have a jack five five right actually

Jack and his wife have three children is

what the papers say here so you you

appear to have a delusion you're smiling

and

taking the seriously my heart is really

beating yeah alright I'm sorry to do

this in such a public place but your

sister is really really worried about

you because Jack and his wife have lost

all patience and they are going to press

charges the next time you call show up

or try to contact their children would

you like to see the restraining order

second yes give you evidence have a look

now I'm going to step out of the role

play okey for those of you who are

wondering this is a role play okay but

let's take let's take close to it though

okay you look at that have you seen

restraining orders before no I haven't

so you wouldn't know what they look like

yeah okay yeah those really are

restraining orders they are absolutely

legitimate restraining orders you page

through them okay and you see them you

give them back to me now that you've

seen these does that make you question

if maybe I'm telling you the truth that

you're not married to Jack it would make

me wonder a little bit but it would make

you wonder yeah really yeah if they've

had a who proposed to who in my marriage

yeah Jack proposed I never happened

that's what you're telling me I could

convince you with six pieces of paper

that maybe that didn't happen no oh no I

just want to be sure talking about the

same thing remember the birth of your

five children I love them yeah I didn't

happen okay yeah that would be hard to

believe here's the problem we have we

have very limited time here we need to

keep this moving and I apologize is a

very unorthodox way to do an

intervention I don't typically believe

in interventions the Cecile's family was

really really really worried and frantic

because she's about to get arrested and

lose are you working right now no that's

my understanding as well that she's not

been able to work and but she's about to

lose her freedom she's about to get

arrested because she won't stop calling

Jack and Jack's family and kids so the

good news is there is a police officer

waiting outside with an ambulance and

we're able to transport you

to a hospital we have a bed for you

would you go No

why not because I don't believe you I I

have a lot of evidence that I'm would

you like to call Jack sure pick up the

phone and call Jack let's pretend okay

hello are you calling or me

you're calling me and I'm Jack hello hi

hi jack I've got some problems here so

send you to jail but we will don't call

here again I agree to this one phone

call click that really happened

your husband's voice on a real phone

just said that to you does that change

anything well it would change how I feel

inside I'd be crushed but I still have

wedding pictures and all kinds of stuff

phurba in our home you can't go there

you can't go there ok you need to leave

the room

right now I'm sorry so we can get on

with this and and there is an officer

waiting just out I walk you to her if

you like and she'll escort you now you

haven't done anything to endanger

anybody or now that you're not a danger

to anybody else or yourself so she can't

force you to go so shall we either walk

you to your car

or at the very least she's going to walk

you out of the building and she'll show

you the ambulance and you can make a

decision for yourself ok are you ready

to go oh yeah you have your bag here or

I have a purse here ok so let's just do

that real quickly so we can get on with

the presentation ok stop right there

Cecile and I walk out and there is a

police officer yeah and there is an

ambulance when you get to the door that

the officer is really nice and she says

ma'am why don't you go get some help the

doctor seems to really be worried about

you your sister was out here a few

minutes ago she was crying she left

because she didn't want to stay here for

the intervention why don't you go and

get help what do you think you'll do I

guess I'll go and get help because of

all this oppression

what are you gonna get help for well I'm

just gonna try to make you stop

convincing me that this is true so

you're going to get help for the

interpersonal conflicts that you're in

not Burger Mental Illness no mental

illness no so you go to the hospital and

the doctor says I see these restraining

orders I heard from dr. Amador and from

your sister who called earlier I know

dr. ometer is not your treating doctor

but but he was willing to help your

sister out your family out and and I

heard from this man who you've been

stalking and his family and they seem

like really nice people we'd like to

admit you are you up for that no okay

well we can't keep you against your will

all right

so you know sign yourself out AMA that

means against medical advice so you sign

yourself out na what do you go yeah I

would go home she goes like home what

happens to her she's arrested now she's

in the criminal justice system he just

violated a restraining order the judge

gives you a choice to seal you can go we

would you know we're coming up in a

weekend okay we can't do it your

arraignment till Monday you can spend

the next four or five days in jail or

you can go to the hospital and get

treatment what's your choice I need to

know right now my dockets full man

hospital then okay

this case is adjourned I will wait two

weeks for a report from the from the

hospital and thank you to the public

defender you may leave the courtroom so

you leave you go to the hospital they

offer you anti-psychotic medication do

you take it yeah so you don't take it so

the doctor and nurses work with her for

three four or five days and they finally

sit down with they're very sincerely

with a lot of compassion and say to seal

if you won't take your medicine we're

going to tell the judge and they're

going to end up back in front of the

judge soon and likely heading towards

jail for violating the restraining

orders are you sure you won't take this

medicine then I'm going to take it and

she takes an anti-psychotic medication

she's a compliant patient she's a

hearing to the medication

it's really important to us for us to

give the report to the judge that you've

developed some insight and that you'll

accept our recommendations for treatment

when we discharge you in two weeks

can you can you accept that maybe you

have a delusional disorder maybe it's

schizophrenia is what we think it is and

accept our referrals and I'm going to

say yes to get out of the hospital okay

so we give that report to the judge she

says yes

she's on probation and what do you do

when you leave the hospital you've been

able to talk to your kids or Jack the

entire time you've been in the hospital

I mean you talk to your sister and

friends and other family members and

they all are saying what I'm saying what

are you doing to leave the hospital

after two weeks I wouldn't have any

place to go I don't think I will I go

back to my house again go back to her

house her judgment is incredibly poor

you get her and you'd get arrested again

Wow do you see how this happens let's

fast forward six years do you think you

might eventually learn to not go back to

the house yes because you spent some

time in jail the second time by the way

and you learn to say things like I have

schizophrenia I'll take the medicine

maybe you take it or maybe you empty the

capsules

maybe you hide them right maybe you're

like 75% who don't take it or take only

some of it right unless you're on a

long-acting treatment would you after

those six years of not being able to

reach your children not being able to

reach Jack finally come to terms with

this denial and understand that you're

mentally ill and that you were never

married to Jack and never had five

children

I guess I'd give it up out of being worn

out

you'd give what up the idea that I was

married so let me ask you again are you

telling us that if we this is

hypothetical five six years down the

road you think with those experiences

you would come to believe that the

proposal that Jack made to marry you the

courtship never happened now okay yeah

see it's interesting at one level you're

saying yeah I've come to believe a

mentally ill in a way I think it's a

wish probably okay you'd like to think

that you could be convinced you

I'm not get nothing in the world that

I'm going to be able to show you prove

to you that you were never married to

Jack and you didn't have your five

children with him

is there no let's go ten years down the

road no but you may behave in ways that

make it look like you know you're a

patient with schizophrenia mm-hmm to get

along to just get on with life you can

move on yeah

and it's an incredibly lonely place

right let me ask you briefly this is a

roleplay you immediately offered and

thank you very much can we thank her and

you don't have to answer if you don't

want to but you I was going to ask you

did you have any emotion emotional

reaction you started out by saying your

heart was racing yeah what were you

feeling well I was feeling what if

someone told me that everything I

believed wasn't true I just did so what

were you feeling as I was doing that to

you like I was having my life taken away

what about some emotions betrayal like

why would Jack not take a phone call

from me why does he have say as another

wife was this Kevin crying himself to

sleep you know all these things it

didn't make any sense I mean mainly like

parts of me were dissolving parts of you

were dissolving yeah we opened it up to

other people did you want to add any

other feelings you were having okay

thank you very much thank you

hence the seal when you leave please

call Jack okay I don't know where your

kids are after all home or not but call

the ones who aren't at home right

anybody else what were you feeling it is

you put yourself in cecile shoes any

emotions yes

total fear what else good

paranoia right and she started to talk

about it

like why would he be doing this what

else anger anger at who anger at me um

do you know how hard I worked to get my

degree and how hard I work to help I'm

trying to help this damn woman you're

angry at me so this is a little bit of

the things that we go through as

healthcare providers I used to get angry

actually I wouldn't say that loud but I

feel it like you know what it's Friday

I've worked a 70 hour week in the

hospital and I got another person

doesn't think they're ill anger at me

anger at Jack anger at her sister right

any other feelings really bad about

herself yeah yeah yes terror

loss of her identity the way you were

saying you would that was the primary

thing it seemed like you were

experiencing hmm loneliness yeah and

what's the feeling usually linked to

loneliness feeling emotion sadness I

hear that a lot

anybody feel sadness in her shoes okay

let's stop there I want to move forward

from this very lonely frightened sad

experience I've tried to have us have

together and it's just a role play this

is what so many people with unawareness

of illness with NSTIC knows yet feel

this is the position they're in the

world is against them they're all alone

with the truth of their reality that

nobody agrees with and the people who

love them most are often their worst

enemies myself being that that person

for seven years with my brother not

because we want to be enemies we're

trying to help I was trying to help her

but look at the emotions look at the

feelings I was I was eliciting that's

just a flavor of what it's like let me

say one more thing the belief that

you're not ill that solid so like paper

it's not malleable okay

it's that solid folks you can't change

it in somebody with unawareness which

turns out to be when someone says

they're not sick for three six months

and years and they don't it's a symptom

my brother blasts face-to-face

conversation I had with him six months

before his death I asked them Henry

people always ask me do you believe

you're ill and he laughed he's at all

Harvey I got schizophrenia

just like Cecile learned to say I said

now Henry come on it's you and me I was

driving him back to his to his home

after a family dinner I was visiting him

in Arizona actually was about to move to

New York to live near me and our mother

had passed away nine months before so I

was asking him this and he laughed and

said yeah I've got schizophrenia I said

Henry it's you and me come on what I

mean do you really I mean if you do it

that's okay with me

and say that's great that's okay with me

but that's certainly not what you told

me before and he said now I don't

there's nothing wrong with me I said

yeah I thought that's that's what what

you would say

see I didn't say that I thought that's

what you think I said I thought that's

what you would say it's more respectful

communication subtle but it's more

respectful then I said why do you take

your your I can talk about it's a

generic drug Prolixin shots why why are

you doing that

well you and mom-and-pops think I should

do it mom and pops are Betty and James

who ran the board and care he lived in I

tried to get him into some really really

really nice supervised supported housing

situations and he would sabotage it and

leave every time because he wanted to

live with Betty and James who were two

people who loved him so what was my

brother saying in shorthand

he took medication for 18 years because

of what relationships and one of the

things that I say over and over again is

I never won on the strength of my

argument that he was mentally ill and

needed treatment just like I will never

win with Cecile on that argument on the

proof I want him the strength of my

relationship but I respected him I

didn't judge him I conveyed frankly the

kind of love if you're a professional

you can still do that you can still be

your patient your clients friend people

who say I can't I was trained never to

be friends with my patients that's

inappropriate that's crossing boundaries

and the analogy I use is anyone have

friends at work yeah that you don't

invite home for the holidays or family

vacations right you have boundaries with

your friends at work we can be friends

with our patients with our clients and

if you're a parent you can be friends

with your son or daughter by the way

especially if they're an adult and you

can still be the parent yeah that's what

we're looking for is to create those

those relationships so when dealing with

a nest egg nausea the doctor knows best

approach isn't going to work because

there's no collaboration collaboration

is a goal it's not a given right I can't

expect Cecile to be grateful or

receptive or adherent to my advice right

what I can expect is that she'll be

frustrated and angry suspicious and not

take my advice not take medication not

accept housing not accept programs and

either overtly refuse or learn to

secretively refused to do that one quick

word because I I just wouldn't feel

right if I didn't talk about this both

the research and my clinical and

personal experience very clearly in my

view point to long-acting therapies as

being indicated for for those people who

don't believe they're ill and actually

for others

I call them long-acting therapies why in

the world the only company in the u.s.

that launched a new generation

anti-cycling therapy shows ads with

needles in it with daisies coming out of

it and focuses on the needle needle

needle needle and I consult to that

company and I when I first saw that ad I

said please don't run that and focus on

the injection why are we focusing on the

injection that's not what's important

what's important is it's long-acting and

we have 100% confidence if the person is

taking it we know which changes our

interactions with the person if you look

at the research and there's more than

this compared to oils only 17% on

average tend to drop out of a

long-acting therapy that's 83% on it the

numbers flip and it's common sense where

my brother would miss an appointment

which is rare I had permission to be

contacted and I would get get on the

phone and I would just have a chat with

him and I wouldn't call him to say why

didn't you go to your appointment he

would eventually just tell me I didn't

go to my appointment is that the reason

you're calling I said well yeah it's the

timing of the reason what's wrong are

you are you okay I didn't push it oh oh

I know you really get worried about me

if I don't take it that's how it works

it's like a smoke alarm for health care

providers when you do if you're a

psychiatrist especially you've got your

15 minutes of fame with your patient

once a month or once every three months

you don't have to ask them so are you

taking the medication how much are you

taking you already know you can start

talking about things that matter

to the person so how you feeling what's

going on with your friend Darrell you

were telling me about or your boyfriend

or the job that you've been trying to

get it these therapies actually change

the relationship by eliminating the

suspicion and the humiliation

if you ever checked to see if somebody

swallowed a pill very humiliating

imagine I'm working with Cecile

inpatient unit Cecile takes the pill

which open your mouth please

all right lift up your tongue please do

it right now lift up your tongue okay

thank you now to drink a little water

thank you how'd that feel you're

laughing but how did it feel yep

humiliating right that's gone when you

use long-acting therapies they improve

relationships actually people don't

usually talk about that so if you with

leap or any other method convince

someone who's not taking medication who

needs it

the premises the person would benefit

from it to take medication please look

into research long-acting therapies and

there's more coming

becoming available soon so we have more

choices

yes I'm going to stick with

schizophrenia right now but yes it to

the extent that the antipsychotics that

are used in other mental illnesses form

yes yeah

I'm going to skip over this in the

interest of time how much time do we

have left we're good

but basically if you look at what works

this is 20 years of research review that

these authors did it's in the American

Journal of Psychiatry

I'm very sorry the slides have been cut

off at the bottom of the slide is our

website and I'll give it to you at the

end of the talk where you can if you

register at the website you'll get free

chapters from the book I'm not sick

three free chapters you'll get

subscriptions gets a premium magazine

you'll get access to there's videos and

things there's lots of free resources

there so I hope you'll go there and and

have a look I think you can actually

look at the free videos without

registering too if you don't want to

give your information but these authors

looked at 20 years of studies and they

basically found that psycho education

was common in clinical practice but it

typically didn't do anything in terms of

helping people become more engaged in

treatment so imagine I sense the seal to

a group with a bunch of people with

schizophrenia and she comes out is that

going to make her more likely to take

her medication no you know and my

brother said when he came out of his

first psycho education group I'm not

going back why not they're all sick how

did you know that

now you're reading Henry's mind and he's

dead that's scary I mean it's pretty

weird right because it's common

experience because the person doesn't

believe they're ill since I was so light

about Henry's death let me just say

something quickly that how my brother

died

I'm here to very rich in meaningful life

by his own account and that of others

especially the last five years he was

living with Betty and James he was

working part time for James for free and

doing light construction he was also

volunteering it at this church sweeping

every morning he got up and went to the

Mexican restaurant ran run by my friends

Marcela and Sandra Davila who are my

angels and Henry's angels who would give

Henry big hugs and kisses feed him and

then give him the five dollars I sent to

them that's he but he didn't go there

for the for the money he loved Sandra

and in Marcela and then unknown to me

unbeknownst to me he went to another

restaurant around the corner in downtown

Tucson called Phil's cafe now I found

out about this because after he died I

got a phone call from Phil's cafe asking

if their daughter Phil and his wife

asked if their daughter Jacqueline could

sing and my brother's funeral I didn't

know if this was a three I was torn up I

was a mess at the time and and I just

said yes and then afterwards I thought

what if this is like a two-year-old or a

three-year-old I had no idea it's a 17

year old a young woman who was

unbelievably talented I actually have it

recording it is beautiful and she really

sang about her relationship with my

brother and how positively he had

impacted on her I learned so much about

his life that I didn't know at his

memorial after going to Phyllis cafe he

would take the bus back to the clubhouse

then hit the clubhouse to take the bus

back to his neighborhood he had gotten

on the city bus noticed a woman behind

him with groceries struggling he stepped

off the bus and he said you go ahead and

he was handing her her bags when and

this is really incredible

the ironic a man with diabetes who was

not apparently managing his diabetes

insulin dependent diabetes went into a

diabetic episode and became unconscious

and drove onto the sidewalk and ran my

brother down but my brother died doing

what being Henry being the man who I

lost when he used to say I'm not sick

and I would argue with them I forgot who

he was to his court and to his court he

was kind gentle guy you know even the

moment of his death I mean it's amazing

that's not that's not a random thing

that's how he lived his life

compassionate kind guy very responsible

and I used to think I'm sorry I'm being

emotional this is five years ago now

almost four and a half years ago

actually I'm not sorry I just means I

love them right I still do but the thing

about Henry is that he had a lot of

compassion and I used to accuse him of

not caring about his family I don't know

if any of you have done that don't be

hard on yourselves now that you

understand I hope that this is a symptom

because would you ever tell somebody to

stop hallucinating just cut it out don't

you know what your hallucinations are

doing to mom

why not because they can't stop and once

I understood that Henry couldn't stop

saying I'm not sick boy it just freed me

up and it freed us up you know and I and

I still and I saw him again for who he

really was so it's a very powerful piece

of information let's talk about leap

briefly and let's practice a couple of

the tools in the time we have left okay

and I'm looking at my time keeper when

do you want me to break okay leap was

first developed the predecessor to lead

was called mate for medication adherence

and insight therapy doesn't exist

anymore but I mentioned it because it

was developed by Aaron Beck and myself

Aaron Beck is the person that some of

you may know is the father of cognitive

therapy he invented cognitive therapy

and still does research in and promotes

its use in all sorts of psychotic

illnesses what I discovered in when we

had a grant from the National Alliance

for research on schizophrenia and

depression was that anybody could do the

kinds of things we were teaching and I

really developed a simpler version of

mate called leap it stands for listen

reflectively without judgment right

while conveying respect

remember that slide earlier about what

predicts adherence empathize very

strategically around those feelings that

Cecille has that leave her isolated and

alone and disconnected my god it must be

so frightening for you to not be able to

see your children and wonder what Jack

why Jack would do this are you

frightened are you angry about it I

would be too she's nodding yes that's

what leap sounds like now that sounds

kind of dangerous to some people doesn't

that sound like I'm agreeing agreeing

with her delusions I'm not and we'll

come back to this in just a moment I'm

giving you the overview first what you

do is you focus on the areas of

agreement at CAA and lead what do we

agree on staying out of the hospital

let's see if we can convince you not to

see Jack because all that's been doing

for the last six years is getting you in

trouble over and over and over

again right I know you want to see them

but can we agree or not if we can't

agree that's okay but can we agree that

that's a goal that we could work on

since you're court-mandated to meet with

me anyway let's do something with our

time she's nodding yes so maybe this is

hypothetical but it's very I'm drawing

from experience and then we partner on

that that's the P in leap now this book

I'm right you're wrong now what is

written for all sorts of situations not

just dealing with persons with serious

mental illness because what's happened

is over the last 12 years we've trained

trained tens of tens of thousands of

people we have an all-day lead training

we now have trainings online and people

will come up to me and say hey I own a

business I want you to know I've been

doing this in my business would you come

and consult with us family therapy

parents with their kids and so after

doing a lot of interviews and

consultations the I'm right you're wrong

now what book is a is a description of

those experiences this has published

four years ago in 2008 by Hyperion so if

you want to get a broader picture of

lead what I really love about about this

book it's it's endorsed by a United

States Ambassador who says is exactly

what we do in international diplomacy

it's endorsed by to business

best-selling business writers this is

what you do in business by a family

therapist by a director of a cognitive

therapy Institute I mean it's really

it's it's it's really wonderful and you

know what I didn't invent any of this

it's one of the first things I say in

the book these are timeless simple

psychological truths that we put

together into an easy kind of toolkit so

let's talk about that toolkit all right

the very first tool is listening

reflectively now you came in here with

all sorts of tools the same tools I had

with my brother

imagine that either you have a tool belt

or a tool box and half of that tool belt

or tool box are filled with those other

tools trying to educate cecile that

she's ill giving her the evidence

telling her what her options are now the

other side is empty let's fill it with

some some other tools reflective

listening is simply this I listen to the

purpose to the person

with the purpose of reflecting back what

they told me so I can find out what

first of all if I understood them

correctly and I can also convey through

my active reflective listening that I

don't judge or disrespect what they're

saying so the goal is simply reflect

back what the person said don't add your

two cents it sounds pretty simple right

so who would like to try it first

okay would you mind coming up here and

I'm going to need you to use the

microphone I'm sorry so I'm going to ask

volunteers who are up close like our

first volunteer or volunteers who are

able to safely run and have signed the

waiver that if you get injured in the

auditorium you won't sue the library

what's your name

Richard okay Richard I'm going to go

right into a role play of a patient of

mine a real a real guy yeah Richard you

want to help me then understand

something I'm not mentally ill I don't

need these damn medicines you can help

me with the people upstairs

every night they flush the toilets to

communicate with those people who are

trying to kill me how can I help you

okay good

was that reflecting back anything that I

said no what did you do instead tried to

sell it the problem very good so one of

the first three most common mistakes is

you responded you reacted instead of

reflected you didn't absorb it reflected

back but you know we're laughing but he

did a nice thing didn't he he's trying

to help me right but it's such a simple

tool why didn't what couldn't you do it

I'm sure you're intelligent enough I'm

guessing you are nobody gets this right

during a full league training we'll

spend half an hour doing this we'll do

it 15 times before somebody gets it

right I forgot about that and just

wanted to solve a problem yeah what want

to try it again now that we have

reviewed it so just reflect it back okay

you want to help me even understand

something I'm not mentally ill I don't

need these damn medicines you can help

me with the people upstairs I know what

they're doing every night they flush the

toilet to communicate with those people

who are trying to kill me okay so let me

see if I got this right people upstairs

flush the toilet every night

and they're in communication with people

that are trying to kill you

yes beautiful nice job right okay

and thank you for making the other

common mistake which is you left out two

of the other most important things

omission leaving things out that we are

uncomfortable reflecting back it's very

common

so reacting or responding and then

leaving things out now you don't have to

reflect back every single thing the

person says but at least hit the

important ones I'm going to ask you take

a seat let's ask for another quick ball

they get a free copy of your book yes

you did thank you see I reacted I did

not reflect your wish it was your

question whether you would get a free

copy of the book for volunteering I

understand you okay that's reflective

blessing okay can you get to the

microphone quickly I'm so sorry about

the and then we're going to we're going

to move on to why people don't do this

what's your name

that Valerie I'm going to start while

you're making your way to the to the

microphone listen carefully and people

complain

there's too much emotion so let me take

that element out of this now I'm going

to do it quietly and slowly

Valerie you want to help me please

understand something not mentally ill I

don't need these damn medicines it can

help me with the people upstairs they're

communicating with you people who are

trying to kill me they're using the

toilet to communicate okay so you don't

need to take these medicines and there

are people upstairs communicating to you

that they're trying to kill you my god

they're not they're admitting it to me

at all okay so they are flushing the

toilet trying to kill you

no they're communicating with other

people with that toilet they're all part

of the conspiracy of the people who are

trying to kill me okay keep going no

you're I like what you're trying to do

here

um if you want to go further I guess

that's all I thought okay stop thank you

very good but you also made the common

mistake of omitting things right and you

let me start with a very subtle omission

you said you don't need the medications

he didn't say that I don't need the damn

medicines you're not really capturing

what I said to him is you really don't

need these medicines how many might even

have said you don't need these damn

medicines you know he was adamant about

it it's a subtle thing but you left out

some really big items you know what they

were anyone or let's start with you in

fairness one I know you don't okay let

me just tell you there's seven elements

to this roleplay Wow only seven that's a

lot what are the limits of short-term

memory everyone no five plus or minus

two right so you should be able to is it

seven no it's only five yeah five

actually in this role play I'm not sick

I don't need this damn medicines if you

want to help me you can help me with the

people upstairs for flushing the toilet

to communicate with the people who are

trying to kill me there's only five

elements what did she leave out anyone

I'm not sick that she said you reflected

back that I don't need the damn medicine

it's fantastic

what else did she leave out people are

flushing the toilet she got there to

communicate as a form of communication

it's called a delusion of reference it's

hard to reflect back delusions you can

take your seat thank you by the way

thank you get out have to leave out so

we can wrap what right that she that

this young man wanted my help and when I

do this I don't usually do it this way

I'll do ten role plays so people can

really experience it and see Wow when

you listen you think you get it but

until you try it you don't so here's

what it sounds like Javier if I

understood you correctly let's just slow

down you seem really upset would that be

okay I just want to make sure that I'm

following you I had to calm them down a

little bit you're not mentally ill you

don't need these damn medicines you'd

like me to help you with these people

who are trying to kill you it's

the people using the toilet to

communicate with each other is that

right it's really easy to do anyone

uncomfortable with that and why yes why

what and why did I agree with them

reiteration is not agreement right

why are you uncomfortable because it

sounded like I was agreeing was I

agreeing No

if I just listen and try to interjecting

in an interest of time and so people can

hear and understand and tell me if I get

it wrong my son's delusions it sounds

like I'm tacitly I think you were going

to say agreeing with them or supporting

it or encouraging it encouraging and

making it worse anyone here ever talk

anybody out of a delusion you cannot

talk somebody further into it and

there's research on that so letting

someone make the mistake that you might

agree with them doesn't make things

worse it only makes things worse if you

lie and say you agree when you don't

okay and why are we doing this it should

be the other question people are

starting to have because we want to have

a communication where the person feels

their point of view is respected and not

judged and I'm going to give my opinion

about treatment to this guy which I did

right you don't need the medicines right

yeah I get that if I were you I'd be

pretty angry about everybody telling you

to take the medication I have an angry

dr. Amador

you know I'd be angry too I did all that

with him well what do you think you

think I'm mentally ill what did I do

i delayed answering that question as

long as possible and then when I gave it

my answer I used one of the leap tools

where you convey your opinion in a very

respectful humble way I'll show you and

then we're going to wrap it up but we're

listening especially to delusions if the

person has them to the beliefs about not

being ill and most importantly what they

want this young man wanted me to help

him with the people who are trying to

kill him and when I reflected this back

so you're not sick you don't need

medicine you'd like me to help you with

these people who are trying to kill you

he said would you write a letter to the

co-op board saying I'm not mentally ill

because they're trying to kick me out

because he was banging on doors at 3:00

in the morning 2:00 in the morning

confronting people now what did I do you

know this is why we don't reflect

because we worry that we're going to be

asked to do something we can't do we

worry we're going to make it worse

that's your worry right we were worried

about injuring the therapeutic alliance

because it makes it sound like we

believe them and that we're being

dishonest of what happens when they find

out that we don't with there's only

seven communication strategies or tools

you can do this

lots of people are doing this so I just

wanted to give you a flavor for it

delaying your opinion is for two

purposes to get the person to ask for

your opinion an opinion that's been

asked for carries more weight than an

opinion that has been given without

being asked for how many women in the

room have been pregnant and gotten free

advice from strangers in the street okay

and how did that feel

did ever feel intrusive yes did ever

feel I'm beginning yes has ever feel

disrespectful and yet each of you

probably had a woman who you trusted who

you went to for help and advice a mother

a sister a grandmother and his advice

you considered if not followed about the

pregnancy what's the difference in one

case you had a relationship but in in

the other case you didn't but the other

big difference is you asked so that's

why we delay we delay very respectfully

I promise I'll answer your questions to

seal about Jack we work together and she

asked me are you married my marriage

Jack do you believe me but if it's all

right with you I'd like to talk more

with you about staying out of jail would

that be okay and I asked permission I

put her in charge that's giving you a

flavor for how you can delay honestly

and with respect and then when you give

your opinion we call it the three A's

apologize acknowledge your foul ability

you could be wrong and agree to disagree

Cecile you've asked me several times

about Jack and I'm sorry this might be

hurtful now she already knows what I'm

going to say might be hurtful to you and

I could be wrong I don't know everything

I'm comfortable saying that I don't see

it the way you see it I wish I did I

truly wish I saw it I just I don't want

to be one of those people that argues

with you about Jack I'd rather focus on

all those areas that we agree on one of

the leap tools is apologizing and I

would apologize do you see how different

that is than saying what I said to her

when I was sitting in that chair before

I'm creating a relationship where I'm

really respecting her and not judging

her and I start to encourage her to

maybe take some medication to help her

deal with her anxiety or heart was

racing whatever the problems are that

she describes I'm always looking to

empathize and normalize her experience

I'd feel the same way you're feeling so

you agree with me I'm married well I

promise I'll tell you what I think but

if it's all right with you I just want

I'd like you to stay here with your

feelings if I were in your position I'd

be really lonely and angry too you see

how you can mix up the tools right and

we're always focusing on those problems

that we can agree on and when we

disagree agree to disagree

and we set goals that we partner on like

taking the medication so you get a

night's rest accepting this referral to

this residence so that you can you can

stay out of jail you know or something

perhaps less coercive than that there's

lots of things you can agree on so I'm

going to end here and just summarize the

seven lead tools

listen empathize agree partner delaying

I touched on giving your opinion slowly

giving it with respect and sprinkling

your dialogue with with apologies yeah

I'm sorry that I think differently than

you do I wish I agreed with you is what

is the most powerful apology I'm going

to jump ahead and we'll skip over this

this is just about some trainings that

happened in Turkey believe it or not we

had 15 psychiatrists come over and ended

up training about 600 people I think in

Turkey psychiatrists and family members

but since it wasn't shown on the bottom

I'm sorry I will throw it up this is the

website where there are free videos

there's there's other courses as well

and there's free literature that you can

get on leap so all this stuff I skipped

over quickly at the end is there in

depth there's an hour and 20 minute leak

training I did in Copenhagen that's free

on this website so if this seems like

something that might be helpful to you I

hope you'll you'll have a look and

certainly it's all in the book as well

but you have to buy the book except for

the volunteers so thank you very much

for your attention

I saw you I'm not gonna take any

questions now

here

you
